is this the one you like playing The Most?

could use point {x,y} and rectangle {x, y, width, height}
but that would be inefficient
just stick to the same as LÃ–VE (and raylib) and use x,y,width,height

try as a .zip file in case variants and assets don't load
try to make an Android build

card rounded corners
scrunching (from gosol)
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beleaguered_Castle
	each pile should know it's limit, calculated during layout
	screen scrunch rect or baize scrunch rect?
	after a card has finished moving, it should check if it's over limit
	also check when popping, and fan factor is not at maximum
	maybe use -1 for width/height of box to indicate 'window boundary'
		otherwise would need to rerun layout everytime the baize scrolls!
		but still need to refan after baize scroll
	could wait until user goes quiet before check if peek() cards are outside the box
		liking this idea
