is this the one you like playing The Most?

could use point {x,y} and rectangle {x, y, width, height}
but that would be inefficient
just stick to the same as LÖVE (and raylib) and use x,y,width,height

REGRESSION TESTS
	collect on an virgin Duchess
	collect on a completed game
	undo Duchess after first move
	exit when game is complete - restart - is another win recorded?

+ UI scaling when dpi is high?

	getSafeArea() - values returned are in DPI-scaled units (the same coordinate system as most other window-related APIs), not in pixels.
	The units of love.graphics.getWidth, love.graphics.getHeight, love.mouse.getPosition, mouse events, love.touch.getPosition, and touch events are always in terms of pixels.
	love.graphics.getMode() returns pixels

retire done_all from gosol
new scrunch algorithm & logic to gosol

BUG jammed American Toad; just because a pile is conformant doesn't mean it's collectable
	pile needs to have collectable card on top
	empty foundation started from 7
	remaining pile was 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, K, Q, J
	conformant has no meaning
	it doesn't for spider anyway
	retire Baize:conformant and script:conformant
	leave Pile:conformant (only used when there are discard piles) - find another way

Are you sure? dialog
	for reset stats
	resign game

pile:moveTailError AND script:moveTailError
	couldn't pile call script?
	script:moveTailError() checks that tail is conformant, returns err string
	script:unsortedPairs() says HOW conformant a pile is, returns an int

Variant de-pickle:
	pileTapped
	tailTapped
	percentComplete
	unsortedPairs
		used by percentComplete and conformant, but only on Tableau piles
		the other six pile types can give quick answers

shuffling animation?
	face down cards get spinning then dealt?

mirror ord and suit on simple cards for Beleaguered_Castle

debug small display of moves, tmoves, fmoves

import/export stats (to and from opsole)

count unsuccessful taps
count undos
	...special prize for completing a game with both == 0

guide to making a new variant
	pick up new variants automatically?

not entirely happy with card flipping
	look at some other apps

fan factor in a mixed pile
BUG mouse fatigue when not moving
check FAN_LEFT
parameterize UI colors
https://github.com/healeycodes/boids
scrunching (from gosol)
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beleaguered_Castle
	each pile should know it's limit, calculated during layout
	screen scrunch rect or baize scrunch rect?
	after a card has finished moving, it should check if it's over limit
	also check when popping, and fan factor is not at maximum
	maybe use -1 for width/height of box to indicate 'window boundary'
		otherwise would need to rerun layout everytime the baize scrolls!
		but still need to refan after baize scroll
	could wait until user goes quiet before check if peek() cards are outside the box
		liking this idea
		_G.BAIZE.lastInput (mouse/touch/key)
settings UI
	tidy up radio, checkbox widget
	baize color >
	card face color >
	card back color >
