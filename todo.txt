LÖVE Solitaire
	is this the one you like playing The Most?

	could use point {x,y} and rectangle {x, y, width, height}
	but that would be inefficient
	just stick to the same as LÖVE (and raylib) and use x,y,width,height

REGRESSION TESTS
	collect on an virgin Duchess
	collect on a completed game
	undo Duchess after first move
	exit when game is complete - restart - is another win recorded?

ANDROID
	Android LÖVE app runs 11.3, so doesn't handle orientation, need to build APK/AAB
	"if you just distribute .love files for android, where the game always starts in landscape mode. "
	Android ww=1176 wh=1008
	https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.rotate
	scale
	love.window.getDPIScale( ) returns 1 on Linux, 3 on Moto G4

	Ascension
	stats on a yellow lined pad

+ 'Moved' 'cards must be the same suit'
	error messages returned as all lower case,
	so prefix and caps can be applied before toasting

+ AreYouSure message box UI object
	start by converting toast to container
	then FAB to (round) container?
	then dialog as a container
		with title, text, button strip (or generalised alignment horz/vert strip), button widgets

+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Quilt_(solitaire)
	requires rotating a pile (Reserve) by 90 degrees

+ card rotating
	angle set by owning pile
	love.graphics.rectangle does not have an angle parameter
		so will have to create canvas graphic for piles
		which updates when label/symbol is set
		and use love.graphics.draw
		"t's possible to rotate an object about its center by offsetting the origin to the center. Angles must be given in radians for rotation."
	card needs to transition/animate when popping and pushing
	hit testing changes, geometry needed
	fanning changes

+ dynamically create pile img
	+ set font when creating pile (ord font for labels, rune font for runes)
	+ test for nil and create
	+ set to nil when updating label or rune; need a setLabel() function

function Baize:createPileTextures()
	-- normal pile
	-- normal pile + label (one for each label)
	-- discard pile
	-- normal pile + recycle rune
	-- normal pile + no recycle rune
	-- label font (== ord font) and rune font are different
end

retire done_all from gosol
new scrunch algorithm & logic to gosol

BUG jammed American Toad; just because a pile is conformant doesn't mean it's collectable
	pile needs to have collectable card on top
	empty foundation started from 7
	remaining pile was 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, K, Q, J
	conformant has no meaning
	it doesn't for spider anyway
	retire Baize:conformant and script:conformant
	leave Pile:conformant (only used when there are discard piles) - find another way

pile:moveTailError AND script:moveTailError
	couldn't pile call script?
	script:moveTailError() checks that tail is conformant, returns err string
	script:unsortedPairs() says HOW conformant a pile is, returns an int

Variant de-pickle:
	pileTapped
	tailTapped
	percentComplete
	unsortedPairs
		used by percentComplete and conformant, but only on Tableau piles
		the other six pile types can give quick answers

shuffling animation?
	face down cards get spinning then dealt?

mirror ord and suit on simple cards for Beleaguered_Castle

debug small display of moves, tmoves, fmoves

import/export stats (to and from opsole)

count unsuccessful taps
count undos
	...special prize for completing a game with both == 0

guide to making a new variant
	pick up new variants automatically?

not entirely happy with card flipping
	look at some other apps

fan factor in a mixed pile
BUG mouse fatigue when not moving
check FAN_LEFT
parameterize UI colors
https://github.com/healeycodes/boids
scrunching (from gosol)
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beleaguered_Castle
	each pile should know it's limit, calculated during layout
	screen scrunch rect or baize scrunch rect?
	after a card has finished moving, it should check if it's over limit
	also check when popping, and fan factor is not at maximum
	maybe use -1 for width/height of box to indicate 'window boundary'
		otherwise would need to rerun layout everytime the baize scrolls!
		but still need to refan after baize scroll
	could wait until user goes quiet before check if peek() cards are outside the box
		liking this idea
		_G.BAIZE.lastInput (mouse/touch/key)
settings UI
	tidy up radio, checkbox widget
	Colors... (with palette for each) (specify text widget foreground/background color)
		baize 		(green/blue/black)
		card face	(white/ivory/gray)
		card back
		club		(black/indigo/green)
		diamond		(red/crimson/orange)
		heart		(red/crimson/orange) (used as diamond color if 2-color cards)
		spade		(black/indigo/green) (used as club color if 2-color cards)
