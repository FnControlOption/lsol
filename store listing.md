A collection of solitaire games, with clear graphics, a simple interface, no fees, and no adverts.

Made by, and for, solitaire enthusiasts; not by someone trying to sell you something or collect your data.

This app is a complete re-write of the older solitaire app (com.oddstream.solitaire) which it replaces.

It is quite 'hard core', offering little in the way of help or hints when playing; the aim is to replicate the feel of playing with physical cards.

= Why create yet another solitaire app? =

Solitaire games have been around for hundreds of years, and for good reason: they're simple, absorbing and fun to play.

Most people know Klondike, and a few more know Spider or Freecell or Pyramid, but there's a lot more to solitaire than that.

(Klondike is not a very good game, because you have about a 33% chance of winning each game, and that mostly comes down to luck. Contrast that with Freecell; over 99% of games are winnable, and each is won by 99% skill.)

= What makes this different from other solitaire apps? =

No adverts, no fees, no spooky permissions, no tracking.

This solitaire is all about flow. Anything that distracts from your interaction with the flow of the game has been either been tried and removed or not included. "Weniger aber besser" (less but better) as they say in Germany.

Crucially, the default cards are simple and easy to scan; the games can be played by tapping the card you wish to move, and the software figures out where you want the card to go.

Also, the games are authentic, by taking the rules from reputable sources and implementing them exactly.

If your favorite version is not included, email us and tell us why it's your favorite and we'll add it if persuaded.

In any case, send some feedback about what you like and don't like.
